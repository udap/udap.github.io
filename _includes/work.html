                                                 <p class="p1">The fundamental concept of the Internet of Asset Protocol is to build 
                                                 a "Thick Protocol + Thin Application".</p>
                                                 <p>Application developers only need to have sufficient knowledge and understand their business logic and user experience, Therefore,  
                                                 the application is thinner and easier.  A thick protocol based on UDAP middleware helps them to accelerate the blockchain development, 
                                                 to secure the transactions,  and to reduce the development costs.</p>
