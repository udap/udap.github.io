		<div>We live in a world of certificates; documents that confirm or ‘certify’ the truth of something or confirms that someone has fulfilled the requirements of and may practice in a field or discipline. 
Examples include birth certificates, land titles, diploma and degree certificates, wills, professional certificates, memberships, receipts, securities, driver’s licenses, all kind of contracts and promises.

For instance, Party A is a witness to something that has occurred between Party B and Party C at a point in time.

		<div>Product introduction
</div>
		<div>The history of a person (male or female) is filled with certificates throughout life. Paper documents that if not saved in a safe, secure convenient place could easily be lost, stolen or destroyed. We need a convenient way store, protect and quickly access these valuable information assets and potentially make them available beyond an individual’s life span.
</div>
		<div>The Cert-Wallet is the world’s first Ethereum-based wallet designed for organizations and individuals to issue/receive/store/cancel blockchain-based digital certificates.
The Cert-wallet is based on a true ID system. All parties must be verified with their real-world identifications.  Institutional or individual users must have been known as a true real-world entity before they can create or receive any blockchain certificates. Certificates can be issued individually on the mobile app, or in batch with a web application.
