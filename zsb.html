		<div>We live in a world of certificates: birth certificates, land titles, diploma and degree certificates, wills, professional certificates, memberships, receipts, securities, all kind of contracts and promises. In fact, most personal data can be considered as various certificates that state that party A has witnessed that something has happened to party B at a time point. 

</div>
		<div>The history of a man is all the certificates that he has received thus far in his life. We need to convenient tool/medium to create/receive/store such precious data and potentially make them available way beyond an individual’s life span. 

</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>One of the goals of the wallet is that it should not require the end users to be blockchain-savvy to use the wallet. Thus we will also allow users to pay with fiat currencies for the gas fee, instead of requiring them to acquire some ETH before they can do anything with the certificates. 
</div>
		<div>Button</div>
		<div>The Cert-Wallet is based on a true ID system. All parties must be verified with their real-world identifications.  Institutional or individual users must have been known as a true real-world entity before they can create or receive any blockchain certificates. 
</div>
		<div>UDAP Certificates Wallet
 (Cert-Wallet)
</div>
		<div>The Cert-Wallet uses the Ethereum network as the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to establish identities of certificate counter-parties.  All verified users are associated with specific Ethereum accounts. All certificates must be signed with the private key of the Ethereum account. 
</div>
		<div>Product introduction
</div>
		<div>Privacy is crucial for the wallet users. The certificates are created and delivered to the receivers fully encrypted, end-to-end, with the public-key cryptography.  Certificates are only known the issuers and recipients. It’s up to the recipients to decide if they would make the certificates public on the blockchain, on their own cost of gas. 
</div>
		<div>Welcome！
</div>
		<div>The Cert-Wallet is the world’s first Ethereum-based wallet for any organizations and individuals to issue/receive/store/cancel blockchain-based digital certificates. 
</div>
		<div>In the coming releases, the Cert-Wallet can be used for creating asset-binding certificates that are tradable/redeemable directly in the wallet. 
This would open a whole world of innovative usage scenarios.
